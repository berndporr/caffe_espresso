# Caffe

Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.
It is developed by Berkeley AI Research ([BAIR](http://bair.berkeley.edu))/The Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) and community contributors.

Check out the [project site](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org) for all the details like

This is a stripped down version for pure C++ learning and
classification. See in particular the xor example.
